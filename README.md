### Our solution
Access to weather data, forecasts, sensors and observations is becoming more abundant and accessible.
There is currently no standard for notifying cities and authorities in time to act upon extreme weather events. 

The weather trigger service is an extensible platform that allows aggregation and linking of weather
data from multiple sources such as weather stations, forecasts, IoT sensors, connected cars,
Telecom infrastructure, etc. It provides a flexible UI that allow users
to define alerts and actions that should be taken upon alert triggers.
